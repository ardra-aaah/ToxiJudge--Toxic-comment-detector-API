# ToxiJudge
ToxiJudge is a simple web app that detects whether a user’s comment is **toxic** or **safe**. I made use of a machine learning model trained on the Jigsaw Toxic Comment dataset and deployed the application with Flask on Render. Also, a MongoDB Atlas database was used to store predictions.  

 **Live Demo**: [https://toxijudge-toxic-comment-detector-api.onrender.com](https://toxijudge-toxic-comment-detector-api.onrender.com)  
 Note: The app was deployed and live, but the MongoDB connection was disabled later for security.

## 🛠 Features
-  **ML-powered predictions** – Logistic Regression with TF-IDF vectorisation.  
-  **Web interface** – Clean UI to enter and test comments.  
-  **MongoDB integration** – Saves predictions for future analytics.  
-  **Deployed on Render** – Accessible from anywhere.

##  Running Locally
1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ardra-aaah/ToxiJudge--Toxic-comment-detector-API.git
   cd ToxiJudge--Toxic-comment-detector-API
## To install dependencies, run: 
 ```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## What I Learned
  -Deploying Flask apps with Gunicorn on Render. 
  - Setting up MongoDB Atlas and connecting via Python.
  - Training and saving scikit-learn models for production.
## Future enhancements

  - Add user authentication to the web app.
  - Visualise stored predictions in a dashboard.
  - Extend ML model with more advanced architectures (e.g., BERT).
